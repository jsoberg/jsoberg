<p align="left">
Software Engineer with 10+ years professional experience designing, developing, and publishing large-scale software products, primarily in the Android/Kotlin/Java space. Most of my experience involves delivering multiplatform applications for highly distributed, low reliability, and low bandwidth network environments. I'm passionate about learning through open source projects while I constantly invalidate caches and restart my IDE.
