<p align="left">
Hi all! My name is Joshua Soberg, and I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years professional experience designing, developing, and publishing large-scale software solutions, mainly in the Android/Kotlin/Java space. Most of my experience involves delivering mobile applications for highly distributed, low reliability, and low bandwidth network environments. I enjoy trying out new languages/technologies, contributing to open source projects whenever possible, and *continuously* invalidating caches and restarting Android Studio.

I hold an M.S in Computer Science and a B.S in Computer Science/Computer Security, both from <a href="https://www.esu.edu/">East Stroudsburg University</a>. Currently working full-time as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://fd-software.com">FD Software Enterprises</a>.
